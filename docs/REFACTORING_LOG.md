# Refactoring Log

## Overview

This document tracks the modularization and refactoring progress for the Transcendence 3D project.

## Completed Refactoring

### Phase 1: Module Organization (Completed)

**Date:** November 16, 2025

Created organized folder structure:

- `modules/core/` - Core game logic and configuration
- `modules/pet/` - Pet-related functionality
- `modules/ui/` - UI components and interactions
- `modules/effects/` - Visual and audio effects
- `modules/utils/` - Utility functions

### Phase 2: Code Extraction (Completed)

**Status:** ✅ **STOPPED at safe extraction limit**  
**Total Reduction:** ~215 lines removed from app.js (~8% reduction)

#### Completed Extractions:

1. **modules/core/config.js** (~60 lines)

   - `gameSettings` - Game configuration constants
   - `stageMap` - Evolution stage definitions
   - `stageEmojis` - Stage emoji mappings
   - `timerMap` - Timer configurations
   - `STAT_TYPES` - Stat type array
   - `danceMap`, `trainMap` - Action mappings
   - `danceIndices`, `trainIndices` - Action indices

2. **modules/effects/audio.js** (~20 lines)

   - `fadeOutBgMusic()` - Fade background music
   - `playEvolutionSound()` - Play evolution sound effect
   - `playSound()` - Generic sound playback

3. **modules/ui/overlays.js** (~60 lines)

   - `showTranscendenceOverlay()` - Show transcendence screen
   - `showGameOverOverlayLoss()` - Show game over (loss)
   - `showGameOverOverlay()` - Show game over (generic)
   - `hidePageOverlay()` - Hide page overlay
   - `showNameOverlay()` - Show name input overlay
   - `hideNameOverlay()` - Hide name overlay

4. **modules/ui/dropdown.js** (~15 lines)

   - `setupDropdownMenu()` - Initialize info dropdown menu

5. **modules/ui/nameOverlay.js** (~50 lines)

   - `setupNameOverlay()` - Handle pet naming screen interactions
   - Manages welcome → name input → egg flow
   - **Fixed:** Music continuity (no longer restarts on overlays)

6. **modules/ui/petChat.js** (~10 lines)

   - `updatePetChat()` - Update pet chat message display

7. **modules/ui/eggAnimation.js** (~20 lines)

   - `hideGlitchEgg()` - Egg hatching animation

8. **modules/ui/petContainer.js** (~20 lines)
   - `restorePetContainer()` - Restore/ensure pet container visibility

#### Failed Extraction (Reverted):

**modules/pet/Pet.js** - Pet class extraction  
**Status:** ❌ **FAILED** - Reverted via `git stash`

**Issues Encountered:**
- Care buttons stopped working
- Stat timers not running
- Evolution system broken
- Global state dependencies too complex (`currentStage`, `gameOverTriggered`, `animationConfig`, `loadAndDisplayFBX`, etc.)

**Lesson Learned:** Pet class is too tightly coupled with global state and app.js logic to extract without major architectural refactoring.

#### Reorganized Modules:

- `modules/state.js` → `modules/core/state.js`
- `modules/ui.js` → `modules/ui/ui.js`
- `modules/spectralSineWave.js` → `modules/effects/spectralSineWave.js`

### Code Reduction

- **app.js**: Reduced by ~215 lines (from ~2625 to ~2410 lines)
- **Improvement**: ~8% reduction with better code organization
- **Zero breaking changes** after Pet class reversion

### Other Improvements

- Lowered background music volume from 0.8 to 0.3 for better user experience
- Fixed music continuity: no longer restarts when clicking through overlays
- Removed duplicate event listeners that were causing music issues
- Added safety checks in care action handlers (`!myPet` check)

## Why We Stopped Extracting

### Decision Rationale

After 8 successful extractions and 1 failed attempt (Pet class), we've reached the safe extraction limit. Further modularization is not recommended without major architectural changes.

### Reasons to Stop:

1. **Pet Class Extraction Failed**
   - Too tightly coupled with global state
   - Depends on: `currentStage`, `gameOverTriggered`, `animationConfig`, `loadAndDisplayFBX`, `buttonTracker`, etc.
   - Multiple attempts to fix with `window` globals unsuccessful
   - Breaking changes: care buttons, stat timers, evolution system all stopped working

2. **Remaining Code is Highly Interdependent**
   - Game loop, animation system, and pet logic are deeply intertwined
   - Cannot extract one without refactoring all of them
   - Incremental extraction would introduce high risk of bugs

3. **Global State Management Required**
   - Current architecture relies heavily on global variables and `window` object
   - Clean module separation requires a proper state management system
   - This is a major refactoring, not an incremental extraction

### What Would Be Needed for Further Modularization:

To continue safely, the project would need:

1. **State Management System**
   - Central `GameState` class or store
   - Eliminate global variables
   - Proper state subscription/notification pattern

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Pass dependencies explicitly rather than relying on globals
   - Pet class should receive all needed services as constructor parameters

3. **Event/Messaging System**
   - Decouple modules via events instead of direct function calls
   - Reduce tight coupling between game loop, animations, and pet logic

4. **Major Refactoring Effort**
   - Not incremental - would require significant changes across entire codebase
   - High risk of introducing bugs
   - Would need comprehensive testing

### Recommendation:

**Accept current progress as successful incremental improvement.** The 8 extracted modules reduce app.js by ~8% with zero breaking changes. Further extraction requires architectural redesign, not incremental refactoring.

## Known Issues

### Bug: Pet Chat Shows "undefined is evolving"

**Status:** Identified, fix deferred
**Issue:** Pet name displays as "undefined" in chat messages during evolution
**Location:** Pet chat display logic
**Priority:** Medium (cosmetic issue, doesn't break gameplay)
**Fix Plan:** Will address after completing current refactoring phase

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities:

✅ **All safe extractions completed**  
✅ **Refactoring phase complete**

### Future Work (Requires Major Refactoring):

These items **cannot be safely extracted** without architectural changes:

- **Pet Class** - Requires state management system and dependency injection
- **Animation System** - Tightly coupled with game loop and Pet class  
- **Game Loop** - Central to all game logic, needs event/messaging system
- **Evolution System** - Intertwined with Pet class and global state

### Alternative Improvements:

- **CSS Modularization** - Safe to pursue independently (see CSS_MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md)
- **Documentation** - Add JSDoc comments, API documentation
- **Testing** - Add unit tests for extracted modules
- **Performance** - Profile and optimize without structural changes

## Testing Status

✅ All extractions tested via Vite dev server  
✅ No breaking changes introduced  
✅ Dropdown menu working  
✅ Name overlay flow working  
✅ Background music volume working  
✅ Pet chat updates working (except name bug)

## Git Commit History

1. `Refactor: organize modules into folders and extract reusable code` - Initial structure + config/audio/overlays
2. `Extract dropdown menu to modules/ui/dropdown.js` - Dropdown extraction
3. `Extract name overlay to modules/ui/nameOverlay.js` - Name overlay extraction
4. `Lower background music volume to 0.3` - Audio improvement
5. `Extract updatePetChat to modules/ui/petChat.js` - Chat helper extraction (pending commit)

**Unpushed commits:** 4 (will push after completing current phase)

## Methodology

- **Incremental approach**: Extract small, self-contained functions first
- **Test after each change**: Use Vite dev server + Simple Browser
- **Commit frequently**: One commit per extraction for easy rollback
- **Avoid risky changes**: Defer complex extractions (Pet class, game loop, animations)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Improved code organization
- ✅ Smaller main app.js file
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier future maintenance
